# Snake_Game
This application contains the game Snake. The point of the game is to move around as a little black
square and collect the yellow pellets on screen. As you collect them you become longer and longer. You must
avoid running into yourself or else you'll lose the game. Moving off screen will place you on the opposite 
side of the screen so be careful. 
Once you do lose the app allows you to save your name and score using internal save data. These scores are displayed
on the Score Board screen which displays all past scores in a RecyclerView. This app takes advantage of the Navigation
architecture by using one Activity as a host to switch between Fragments.
